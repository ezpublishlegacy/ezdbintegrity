changelog from version 0.14.0 to 0.14.1

. Made code more robust in case there are problems connecting to the db because of bad legacy config (eg. no ini settings files at all)

. Fixes for changes introduced in version 0.14:

    - fix FK checks that use the same table as both parent and child in joins
    - fix FK checks that have extra WHERE conditions
