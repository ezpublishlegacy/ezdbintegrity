changelog from version 0.13.0 to 0.14.0

. rewritten FK checks to use `LEFT JOIN` instead of `NOT IN (SELECT ...)`.
    This should lead to noticeably faster execution, especially on big databases, at least for MySql.

    *BC* important: if you have added custom FK definitions in your installation via ini settings, and those definitions
    do have extra 'where conditions', they might not work any more, unless each database column name in the where
    condition is prefixed with its table name

. taught the code to check FK definitions involving 2 or more cols

. rewritten some "custom query" checks as FK checks

. added some FK definitions that use 2 columns

. added a few FK definitions for common extensions as well as some for the core database
