changelog from version 0.13.0 to 0.14.0

. rewritten FK checks to use `LEFT JOIN` instead of `NOT IN (SELECT ...)`.
    This should lead to noticeably faster execution, especially on big databases, at least for MySql.

. taught the code to check FK definitions involving 2 or more cols

. rewritten some "custom query" checks as FK checks

. added some FK definitions that use 2 columns

. added a few FK definitions for common extensions as well as some for the core database
